Visualizing rules, groups and their edges through a graph is a great way to understand how Piranha Polyglot works.

We use [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) to generate a .dot file and a .svg image generated by `visualize_rules_graph.py`.
Please follow the instructions to install Graphviz at <https://graphviz.org/download/>.
Moreover, the script also needs the `toml` and `graphviz` python packages.

The script takes as first argument a path for the generated .dot file.
The following arguments are paths for directories containing `rules.toml` and `edges.toml` files.
Optionally, you can provide a `--title` argument to give a title to the generated graph.
To generate the .dot file and the .svg image used in this README (assuming a Python venv and a valid Graphviz installation):

```bash
pip install toml
pip install graphviz
python visualize_rules_graph.py ./java_prebuilt_rules.dot src/cleanup_rules/java --title "Java pre-built cleanup rules"
```

To generate an image for [java-ff_system1](test-resources/java/feature_flag_system_1/control/configurations/) in our tests:

```bash
python visualize_rules_graph.py ./java-ff_system1.dot src/cleanup_rules/java test-resources/java/feature_flag_system_1/control/configurations --title "Java Test Feature Flag Cleanup System 1"

Piranha Playground is a user-friendly web interface for experimentation with refactoring and piranha rules. It minimizes the need for command-line or script-based operations, offering the following core functionalities:


- [**Rule Inference**](inference): Infer piranha rule graphs from before and after code examples and templates.

- [**Rule Improvement**](improvement): Improve initially inferred piranha rules using OpenAI models.

- **Rule Testing:** Test rules on a specific code snippet before applying them to the entire codebase.

- **Codebase Refactoring:** Refactor your codebase with specific rules.

For more detailed information on each functionality, please refer to the respective sections.
